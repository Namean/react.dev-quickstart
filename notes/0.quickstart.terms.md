declared: "Now that you've declared `MyButton`"



A component is a small piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance.


A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.

Notice that <MyButton /> starts with a capital letter. That’s how you know it’s a React component.

React components are JavaScript functions that return markup:

React component names must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags must be lowercase.
